As the player goes through the level he sees plans for the original machine and the broken machine itself that caused this problem, then the plans to save the world from total destabilzation by building another machine, which are however obfuscated after the player looks at them to further delude the original player into thinking that the scientist is bad.  Then the scientist jumps down into the original start of the game again, followed by the shadow player, who wants to stop him, making the exact same dialogue from the start of the game. Now  the player has to pull the lever in the other way to save the world, and we see the cages re-charge. Just before everything is complete however, the shadow player once again interrupts the scientist, how flees again. After the player pulls the lever, we fade to light and then into darkness.
