Extra-hard puzzles with extra cages, that - when all solved and opened - lead to another ending to the game? Maybe if all bonus cages are cleared and the last cage is then opened, the world becomes brighter and brighter as the player goes on (but he can still see the same plans/experiments like in the original ending, just alone; the bonus cages are specially wired up to a different machine that ensures that the dimensions don't split like in the original ending) and when he then re-enters the first level (again, alone) and goes to the part with the lever, the machine breaks because it can't handle that much light, things become even brighter and than everything collapses and becomes black.
