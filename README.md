An indie puzzle game I worked on during high school. Thanks to a dedicated artist & musician it looks presentable.

If you just want to play it, I published a [free version on GameJolt](https://gamejolt.com/games/colored-the-other-dimension/155572).

Note: This repository does have VCS via subversion, I just haven't imported it here yet.
